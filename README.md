**Inserting data from an online lending library to a relational database and writing retrieval queries in Cypher-Neo4j.**

#### The [**data folder**](https://github.com/christakakis/cypher_neo4j_queries/tree/main/data) contains data of an online lending library that records information about the books it has, its users-readers and the borrowing of books by users. The library provides search services for books to users as well as recommendations of books they may find interesting. At the same time, users are able to rate books and lists of the most popular and highest rated books can be provided to users. The online library uses a relational database to store and manage relevant information.

### Firstly, the insertion of the data takes place using the [**loading_data.cql**](https://github.com/christakakis/cypher_neo4j_queries/blob/main/loading_data.cql) file.

### Then, retrieval queries are written using Cypher-Neo4j in order to extract useful information using the **[queries.cql](https://github.com/christakakis/cypher_neo4j_queries/blob/main/queries.cql)** file.

  
This repository was initially created to store my personal python codes but also be available to others trying to build or understand something similar. The codes contained in this repo are made specifically for a Network Analysis and Web Mining course of my MSc program.
